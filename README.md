A tool to brute force scan for open Google Drive folders. 

Probably goes against Google's terms and conditions.
In theory, this tool could find open Google Drive folders.
In practise it would probably take days, weeks, maybe months or years before you found an open folder.
The speed is throttled so as not to piss off Google, but I wouldn't recommend running it regardless.
